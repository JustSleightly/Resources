## April Fools!

There is no such exam. Please don't cancel me :).

Despite not being real, my primary goal was to raise awareness of the expansive realm of VRChat Avatar Unity, and possibly motivate people to continue to improve their skills!

Everything on the exam curriculum consists of real concepts, skills, and applications that each serve their own value/purpose, and is nowhere near fully encapsulating of all there is to learn about VRChat Avatars.

If you're interested in reading up or learning more, check out the following educational resource that [VRLabs](https://vrlabs.dev/) and I just launched!
