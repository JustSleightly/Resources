2. All purchases made on gumroad must be validated through [Discord](https://discord.sleightly.dev) to claim your purchase. This is an automatic process that can be started by opening a ticket via the #open-a-ticket channel. You are purchasing a license key that is then activated to grant you authorization and permissions.

4. Breaking the terms of use of any product will have product access revoked, server access and information blacklisted, and any active licenses/subscriptions terminated without refund.
5. No refunds will be given due to the nature of digital products except in special circumstances under my discretion.
6. If you made a purchase and are unable to access the [Discord](https://discord.sleightly.dev) due to being blacklisted or otherwise, you are not entitled to a refund, as you are warned ahead of time prior to purchase.
7. Chargebacks will result in immediate blacklisting of email/IP/discord/other info, and all product access and active licenses/subscriptions terminated.
8. For any questions/issues with your product access, open up a support ticket via #open-a-ticket.

**I reserve the right to refuse/refund service and ban/blacklist users without appeal. Reasons for such may include but are not limited to:**
1. Affiliation with leaking/ripping/theft
2. Affiliation with malicious parties (usually including the above)
3. Suspicious activity or account history/age/mutuals

# Crediting:
Please credit `@JustSleightly#0001` and provide a link to this [Discord](https://discord.sleightly.dev) server where applicable ([https://discord.sleightly.dev](https://discord.sleightly.dev)) .
